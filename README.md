This is a wrapper for [amzn-base](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/amzn-base) and
[amzn-ship](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/amzn-ship) based on
[sub](https://github.com/basecamp/sub).

It may evolve into something else at some point, but right now the goal is to
change the ui to be more to my liking, enable auto-completion, etc.

`amzn` will source `.amznrc` files in ~/ and the current working directory, in
that order, before running any commands.
