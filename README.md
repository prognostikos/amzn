This is a wrapper for ryandotsmith/amzn-base and ryandotsmith/amzn-ship based on
basecamp/sub.

It may evolve into something else at some point, but right now the goal is to
change the ui to be more to my liking, enable auto-completion, etc.

`amzn` will source `.amznrc` files in the current working directory and ~/, in
that order, before running any commands.
